## 🔥 Pet Project : Cryptocurrency Analytics

The project includes two components:

1. **Cryptocurrency Analytics API server**: Flask API for obtaining data on the value of cryptocurrencies, historical data and analytics (average, median, minimum and maximum cost) with visualization of price changes.

2. **Telegram bot for cryptocurrency analytics**: A bot that interacts with the API server, providing users with the current value of cryptocurrencies, statistics on historical data and graphs of price changes in real time.

#### Implemented functions:
- Connect to a third-party API to get up-to-date data.
- Flash API with functions for getting data and plotting.
- Telegram bot with interactive buttons to select the cryptocurrency and the period.
- Visualization of price changes on the chart, data display via the bot.

#### Development plans:
- Set up regular ETL processes using Apache Air flow to upload data to the database.
- Implement real-time data streaming using Kafka to track changes in the value of the cryptocurrency.
- Add data caching with Redis to speed up API response.
- Implement Spark for advanced analytics such as volatility calculation or trend detection.
- Set up a notification system in the bot to notify you when the price goes beyond the specified limits.
- Store graphs and reports in S3 so that the bot can provide links to them.
